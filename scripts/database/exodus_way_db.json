[{"text": "The Exodus story is the most referenced story across the whole Bible. It's the road out of slavery, the road through the wilderness, and the road into the land of inheritance. This is the theme of the road or the highway or simply the way. Now, one of the most iconic images in the Exodus story is when Israel leaves Egypt, Pharaoh's armies chasing after them, and. And the sea of reeds is in front of them, blocking them in. But miraculously, God splits the waters. There's a wall of water on the right, a wall of water on the left, and dry ground below them as a safe passage. This image is a direct hyperlink to none other than the creation story in Genesis 1. And so in this episode, we begin at the beginning and we see how Genesis 1 shows that the creation of the land and is a type of Exodus liberation.", "start": "00:00:04", "end": "00:00:56", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Exodus in the Creation and Flood Stories"}, {"text": "Yahweh is said to split the waters in the middle and separate between the waters and the waters.

So out of slavery, through the wilderness, into the promised land is the story told in Exodus through Joshua. And that whole story arc gets picked up and told and retold and used like a template to describe other past events in the history of Israel in the Hebrew Bible, and then gets turned into a template for the prophet's hope for what God will do in the future. And it's the template that apparently Jesus saw his life mission through because it culminated in Passover week in Jerusalem. And then when you see his earliest followers using Exodus language and imagery to talk about just what we might call like the basics of Christian belief, you realize that a Christian view of reality is itself as an Exodus shaped story. What is also true then is when you go backwards from the Exodus story into the book that comes before it, Genesis. What you can also see there is there are a number of key events before the Exodus that have been shaped with an eye towards the Exodus story. So even though these events precede the Exodus story in terms of the design of the Torah, it seems that the authors of the shape of Genesis that we now have, it was shaped by someone who wanted us to see the Exodus itself prefigured and anticipated by key events in the story of Genesis.

The abysmal waters. But the ruach, the spirit or breath or wind of Elohim was fluttering or hovering over the face of those waters. So we begin with an overall positive summary statement.

And so that word dry land comes from Yahweh. It's pronounced Yabasha, the Yasha. And this is the word used in Exodus 14, when the waters divide. A wall on their left, a wall on their right, and they walked in the middle on the Yadasha. So again, it's a hint forward and a hyperlink backward between the two stories.

It's not little at all. It was really expensive, too. Called the Tabernacle, prefigured Cosmic mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus. It's his dissertation published. He puts it this way. He says if one were to look for any dramatic tension in the Bible's first narrative. That's 70 creation narrative. It would be in Genesis 1, verse 2, which is the formless and void, wild and waste. The fact that the deluged land, the land that's covered, whatever land there might be, is submerged in the waters right now, the deluged land of verse two cannot sustain life.

And then the water's above and below reconnect. So now land splitting, things being split or separated can be a dual image. If the waters separate, it means salvation. But if the land splits, that's usually bad decreation, earthquakes. So this is just a note on this. Oh, yeah. Interesting essay by a Hebrew Bible scholar. Dominic Redman called the use of water imagery in descriptions of Sheol, that is the grave in biblical literature. And he made a comment. This is really interesting. He says, in Genesis 1, the reader is introduced to a world in which watery chaos rules until God's intervention brings order. The flood story in Genesis 6, 8 tells the story of how when the world was corrupted, God withdrew the restraints placed on those waters at the time of creation, and they flooded the world once more. So the great deep in the windows of the heavens, and thus the chaos waters by their nature are symbolic of the absence of Order and creation. And in the flood narrative, those waters denote the reversal of creation. So again, the fact that in the Exodus story, when the Israelites leave Egypt and then they're just like a few days out, and they meet this big body of water. And Pharaoh's army comes, and then Israel, you're just having it told. And then the sun set and it was night. So they're at this body of water in the darkness. And you're meant to think of Genesis 1. Yeah, this is a Genesis 1, verse 2 moment. And they're meeting those chaos waters. And so in this way, what happens there at Exodus is God tells Moses to stretch out his hand, and we're told the waters split. And it's exactly the word used of the land splitting in the flood story. Baca. And then God sends a wind and keeps the water separated all night long. In the flood story, right at the pivot, after the waters have been over the land for 150 days. Genesis 8, verse 1. Then Elohim remembered Noah and all the creatures and all the beasts with him on the ark.

A bunch of interesting things happen. I want to go move forward to Exodus 15, but let's just pause for a moment and say the story of Abraham is extremely nuanced in portraying the relationship that God has with his people and God's patience. And look at the moral complexity of Even God's involvement in human history. If God makes promises to people, then he has to work with the people as he finds them. And that's such an amazing part of the story that I think is also gets repeated in the future Exodus story, too. All right, next key moment in the Abraham story relevant to the Exodus theme is in chapter 15. And chapter 15 begins with Yahweh speaking to Abram in a vision. We're not told any more detail than that. It's a dream, some altered state of consciousness he was in. All of a sudden, he can see Yahweh speaking to him. And what Yahweh says essentially is, don't be afraid. I've got your back. Because in the previous story, it's a pretty dangerous situation that just happened, and your reward is very, very great.

Yeah, that's right. And it leaves wondering, like why, like why all of this next story. The sequence is so wild. So, okay, I'll actually, I'll reference now. So an Israeli Hebrew Bible scholar, Yair Zakovich, in a hard to find, expensive little book called and you shall Tell youl Sons the concept of the Exodus in the Bible. He's the first one who showed me this trail of breadcrumbs in Genesis. And what he's after here is that the narrator of Genesis is architecting a whole set of reasons for why Israel ended up in Egypt. And this next story that we're about to read right now is kind of like the final breadcrumb that makes you go back and look at the whole sequence that we just went over and read it with new eyes. Okay. And that begins with the story of a woman named the immigrant. So Genesis 16, verse three. Now, Sarai, the wife of Avram, had not yet given birth for him, but she did have a slave girl, an Egyptian one. And that's a link back to. Oh, yes, yeah, the one they got from, like Abraham's deceit, her name was the immigrant Hagar. Sarah said to Avram, look, Yahweh has restrained me from giving birth. So she attributes her inability to give birth to Yahweh, please go into my slave girl. Perhaps I can be built up by means of her. And Sarai, the wife of Avram, took Hagar, her Egyptian slave girl, at the end of 10 years of Avram dwelling in the land of Canaan, and she gave her to Avram, her husband, as a wife. So this also has little echoes here of the woman who is making a decision that feels counter to trusting in God's promise to give child. And she takes the thing and then gives it to her husband.

You will call his name Ishmael, which means God will hear, because Yahweh has heard your oppression. Okay, so check this out. This is so fascinating. This whole sequence right here is all using the language of Exodus, chapters one and two, which describes how Pharaoh comes up with this sneaky scheme to take the people's blessing who are multiplying greatly, and he wants to harness it for his own benefit while killing the immigrants off, especially the boys. And so he oppresses them with slavery. And it's the same word. And then Israel cries out because of their oppression. And Yahweh hears the voice and the outcry of the oppression. And then he raises up Moses as the deliverer. So again, this is Yair Zakovich, and I'll just want to read his comment here. He says, the striking resemblance between Hagar's story and the history of Israel in Egypt is not accidental. The message is clear. The oppression of the Israelites in Egypt is a measure of for measure, that is, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, punishment for how Hagar the Egyptian was oppressed in Abraham's house. The juxtaposition of Genesis chapter 15, which just announced, this is going to happen, this is going to happen. And you were led wondering, why? Why would that happen? And then in 16, you watch Abram and Sarah actually become Pharaoh, and they do to the Egyptian slave all of the things that Pharaoh was going to do to the Israelite immigrants who will become their slaves. It's as if they're fully inverted. But God saw it coming beforehand and leads like, why? Why is this thing going to happen? And then the next story, it's very puzzling. So this is his take on it, is that this story is actually supplying you the reason that it's because of the sins of the fathers that the Children end up suffering, and they suffer.", "start": "00:42:15", "end": "00:44:47", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "How Did Israel End Up in Egypt?"}, {"text": "In a similar way.", "start": "00:44:47", "end": "00:44:48", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "How Did Israel End Up in Egypt?"}, {"text": "They suffer in precisely and, yes, like a similar replay kind of way. So Yair Zakovich, he's Israeli, he's Jewish. So he appeals to one of the most influential rabbis of the medieval period, a Spanish rabbi named Rabbi Moshe Ben Nachman, who lived in the 1200s. And he appeals to this guy, and he says this was this guy's view. And then he quotes him saying, our mother, that is Sarah, sinned by this oppression, and Abraham also by permitting it to be done. And so God heard Hagar's oppression and gave her a son who would, in time, oppress the seed of Abram, Ham and Sarah with all kinds of oppression. Okay, dude, get this. So three generations down the line in the Joseph story, Jacob, who's the grandson of Abraham, sends Joseph out to give some food to his brothers. And he's wearing the special coat. And the brothers see Joseph approaching, and they hate him because of his dreams and all that stuff. And so they say, kill him. And then a couple brothers say, no, don't kill him. Let's sell him as a slave. And then who should come by traveling in a caravan on their way down to Egypt? A bunch of Ishmaelites. They're Ishmaelites, descendants of Hagar. And it's actually the deceitful brothers and Ishmaelites that bring him to Egypt, Joseph, down to Egypt. And that's how the family ends up down in Egypt in the first place.

The shape of Genesis and Exodus is about three generations of these ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, living in this land that was supposed to be a land of gift and blessing to them. It kind of was sometimes, but also was not a lot of times. And really the history of that family in the land was a history of some bright moments of trust and a lot of really terrible moments of people tricking, deceiving, abusing, hurting each other, resulting in the multiplication of a family just full of fractured relationships. And those fractured relationships lead to Israel sitting in exile in Egypt. And then there's this king who comes, and this king, Pharaoh, acts like the snake, and like Abram, like a lying snake who traps the people in slavery. So I think it's part of how the biblical authors are showing the kaleidoscope tentacle effect. I just used two metaphors, but think of, like, an octopus tentacles in a kaleidoscope. And it's just the human condition, right. Of fear branches out and just. And it just. It ruins everything. And if you multiply that over many generations, you just get these horrific situations like the Israelites suffering and slavery to Egypt.

So thank you, Yair Zakovich. I learned a lot about the pre Exodus Exodus story. Also think how Abram's multiplying generations of sin in the land leading up to the exile in Egypt and slavery for many generations. God raises up a new Moses. Excuse me. God raises up a Moses and brings them out of their exile in Egypt on the way to the promised land. So that template right there, you could just scale it up and say that is the Exodus template. Abraham went out of Ur of the Chaldeans. The Israelites go out of Egypt. Abram journeyed to the land of Canaan. Israel went into the land of Canaan. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob just cascade generations of sin. Israel, generations of sin. Abram's descendants go into Egypt in exile, where they're slaves.

So really it's a meta story, a way of imagining the whole world, but it feels like it emerges out of a particular historical experience of a memory of this family of ancient Israelites. And the template goes something like this. There is a liberation out of some sort of terrible circumstance. In the book of Exodus, it's slavery. So Exodus, it's a Greek phrase that means the road out. The road out of slavery, freedom, liberation. Then the journey takes them through the wilderness. We've been calling it the road between. But the reason that you're brought out and taken on the road between is to get to somewhere and that is to get to the promised land to be with God. And so that's the road, the road in. So that's essentially the three part movement and it's that large three part shape that the biblical authors see being repeated on the smaller levels of individual generations and then also on the larger scales throughout history. So we've looked at that story template in the creation stories, we've looked at it in the stories of Abraham and his descendants in Genesis.

So that's the big three part movement. What I'd like to do is just a quick overview how the three movements work in Exodus proper, specifically the first movement. But I want us especially to focus on the famous song of the sea in Exodus 15, because remarkably, it actually contains within itself almost the whole story in a nutshell. And it's like a pivot moment that looks back at the first part, the liberation out of slavery, the road out. It anticipates the road in between and it anticipates the road in. So the poem almost tells the whole story within itself. But first, let's just do a quick overview of how the Exodus story works from Exodus chapter 1 leading up to that song in Exodus 15. So Exodus 1 begins with the family of Israel down in Egypt. It begins with the genealogy of the descendants of Jacob that went down at the end of Genesis. And it says they were fruitful and multiplied. They became many and strong. Very much. Pharaoh doesn't feel great about this. The king of Egypt said, we've talked about this. Ah, we actually have.

But Pharaoh sees a threat to national security. But if they were to enslave this immigrant population that's multiplying, he sees a great economic boon. Boon. So he enslaves them. And it's terrible. And the Israelites cry out, it's terrible for the Israelites. It's terrible for the Israelites. The Egyptians are winning, as they say. So what God does is raise up a deliverer. So that's the first thing from blessing. And then some sort of snaky trickster Move results in slavery. So we go from blessing to slavery.", "start": "00:08:57", "end": "00:09:35", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Israel\u2019s Deliverance and the Song of the Sea"}, {"text": "Because you're saying we talked about the three movements and you're saying the road out movement has a bunch of sub points.", "start": "00:09:36", "end": "00:09:43", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Israel\u2019s Deliverance and the Song of the Sea"}, {"text": "Yeah.", "start": "00:09:43", "end": "00:09:44", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Israel\u2019s Deliverance and the Song of the Sea"}, {"text": "And that first sub point is that you go from a state of blessing to a state of oppression.", "start": "00:09:44", "end": "00:09:50", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Israel\u2019s Deliverance and the Song of the Sea"}, {"text": "Yeah. And again, it's Exodus, but it's being set on analogy to times where that's happened in Genesis too, where you went from the blessing of the seventh day Garden of Eden given to Adam and Eve. But there's a snaky trickster there, and poor decisions are made and you find yourself in the land of dust and death. So similar story arc here, where you begin with blessing a snaky trickster, and then you result in slavery. And so God's response to that sequence in Genesis 1:3 is to promise the seed of the woman who will come to stomp on the head of the snake. God's response to Israel being enslaved is to raise up a seed of a woman, a Levite woman. This begins in Exodus chapter 2. And the sequence from Exodus 2 through 4 is all focused on Moses. So Moses is rescued out of the waters. This is really fascinating. So he's rescued, he's put in his little basket, which is called by the same word as the boat that Noah made, the ark. In Hebrew, it's called that. And he's put into the waters, and then he's rescued out through the waters. In Exodus chapters one through four, there are seven women featured in the story, all of whom play key roles in the deliverance of the people, their liberation from slavery.

So the raising up of the rescuer is all about men and women together being faithful, wise images of God. Yeah, super cool. But Moses actually isn't super wise. He becomes an adult and, you know, famously goes out one day and he sees an Egyptian slave master beating an Israelite slave. And he just straight up murders him and hides him in the sand. And then that results in him having to flee and he goes into exile for a long time and he meets that Midianite woman and then marries into a Midianite family and out shepherding the flock one day, that's when he's up on a high hill and he meets God. So that's the sequence. And what's interesting, that sequence right there, Moses is being one of the enslaved Israelites, is saved through the waters of the Nile river. And then that lands him in the house of Pharaoh. And then he tries to send out his hand and strike an Egyptian to save his people, and it doesn't work. So then he has to flee into the wilderness.

God raises up a deliverer, Moses, for them. And then there's a big showdown between Yahweh, the God of Israel, and Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, resulting in. In Passover, where a plague passes through the land, but those whose houses are covered by the blood of the lamb are delivered from the plague, and they are released to go out of the land into freedom.

Yeah. They weren't making it up. So my goal in just this first step of the conversation is to convince you or anybody who's wondering, why isn't it just an interesting and important story? Why does it rank among the most category setting, foundation setting stories in the Bible? To understand that, let's actually turn to some foundational questions about Jesus and the New Testament that really are only resolved once you see how they connect to the meaning of the Exodus story. Okay, for example, why did Jesus choose Passover weekend as the week when he would show up in Jerusalem and poke the bear, that is provoked Jerusalem's leaders, the priestly and religious leaders, for his showdown with the powers there?

It's not random. And the Gospel authors didn't make this up. Jesus chose that time to go to Jerusalem and He knew he. He was going to get killed. He kept talking about it to his followers, and they really didn't understand what he was trying to tell them. So not only that, but then on the night before his arrest, he chose to time it in proximity to the actual Passover meal. Like the ritual meal that had been celebrated every year for over 1000 years, connected to the night they were delivered from Egypt. And then Jesus explained the meaning of. Of his life leading up to that point and of what was about to happen in his death in terms of the actual, like, bread and the wine of the Passover meal. So Passover is of huge significance if we want to understand Jesus. And Passover is like a linchpin moment in the Exodus story. I guess what would be an analogy. It would be someone choosing a certain holiday whose meaning give a big announcement is so packed to everyone, and then they do on that day something that gives a twist and they don't have to use words.", "start": "00:08:13", "end": "00:09:28", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "Well, the one that's not a twist is getting married on Valentine's Day.

So that's kind of, for me, that's low hanging fruit, like, oh, I should probably understand the meaning of the Exodus story if I want to gain a deeper understanding into the meaning of Jesus death and of the Lord's Supper, which is a ritual, you know, that most Christians do on a weekly or monthly or some kind of rhythmic basis.

That storyline is referenced, referred to more than any other story, more than even the seven day creation story. That's really fascinating.", "start": "00:16:32", "end": "00:17:58", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "Yeah, it is a long story.

It covers multiple books of the Hebrew Bible and you can actually do this with a pretty quick concordance search. Because there's two key phrases introduced in the story itself. The phrase to go out from Egypt, the Hebrew verb yatsa, to go out of and then to go out from Egypt, or the phrase to go up from Egypt. So consistently to go from Israel, Palestine to Egypt was referred to as going down Yarad, to go down to Egypt and then to go from Egypt to the land of Israel is to go up. Okay, so that phrase to go out of Egypt or to go up from Egypt, that phrase appears 99 times. Those two phrases. One of those two phrases appears 99 times within the book of Exodus itself. And then as you move on, the phrase to go out of Egypt or to go up from Egypt, referencing back like these are mentions of the Exodus story going back 17 times in Leviticus, it's referenced in the next scroll of the Torah of numbers 32 times. The departure from Egypt is mentioned in deuteronomy, it's mentioned 56 times. So just within the Torah itself, after it happens, we're referring back to it all the time. Yeah, all the time. And as you go on, it's mentioned 18 times in Joshua, it's mentioned 2 times in Judges, 23 times in 1st and 2nd Kings, it's mentioned 35 times in the prophets, Isaiah, Malachi. And that's just referring to the event. There are almost 20 times within the Torah and the prophets where this phrase is used. I am Yahweh, who brought you out of Egypt, so almost 20 times, from Genesis on through Kings, and then in the prophets, Isaiah, Malachi, 20 times. Yahweh defines his identity as the Exodus.

So one is in Isaiah 11, which is a passage about the rise of a new king from the line of David, who will be anointed with God's spirit and wise and bring justice and so on.

One biblical scholar, I learned from his name, Brian Estelle, who wrote a wonderful book about this very topic. It's a book called Echoes of Exodus. Tracing a biblical motif. He puts it this way. He says the Exodus motif is the Bible's grand narrative. And it is one of the best stories because it encompasses all the major aspects of God's work of salvation through Christ, redemption from sin, suffering, and from the tyranny of the devil. It's an exodus from Egypt from Pharaoh, bringing us into the presence of God represented in Mount Sinai.

So really, from Exodus to Joshua, Especially helpful here are, like in the Psalms, there'll be psalms that recite the foundation story of Israel as for why they should praise God or why Israel should trust God. So I'm thinking about Psalm 78, 105, 136. And those all go from slavery to entry into the promised land. And sometimes they'll tell it in just a few phrases, but it seems like for later biblical authors, that's the art. So it's both an Exodus, a road out of Egypt.

So we started just by saying the Exodus narrative that you find that begins in the book of the Bible called Exodus starts a Storyline that works like a template so that once you read it and hear the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt, the raising up of a deliverer to rescue them, the confrontation with the enslaver that escalates into this really intense conflict through which the oppressor is handed over to his own ruin, and a remnant is rescued out of that ruin and destruction. And there's actually two victory moments we explored, which is the victory at Passover, which is where God brings on Pharaoh what Pharaoh brought on the Israelites. He was killing their sons. So Passover was some sort of plague that took the life of the sons of Egypt, unless God offered something Pharaoh never did, which is a way out, a refuge. And so for the houses that were covered with the blood of a blameless whole, complete lamb, there was refuge. And so that was rescue number one from the oppression of Egypt. And. And then there's rescue number two, which is the people leave Egypt, and then Pharaoh chases them to a shoreline of big body water, and they're rescued as the waters part and they go through on dry land. So that's the road out. Then there's the road between, which is the journey through the wilderness. God's pillar of glory and cloud and fire goes with them. There are tests of trust, and God provides water and bread and meat in the wilderness. And then there is the road into the promised land so that God's people can be his covenant partners, which gets narrated, not way forward in the story until what we call the Book of Joshua, which we're going to look at today. So that whole sequence, the road out of slavery and oppression and all the beats that make that up the road between and then going into the land so that God's people can be his covenant partners. And so Jesus himself and the Gospel authors drew on this template as they portray Jesus and his story leading up to his confrontation with the leaders in Jerusalem. They portray all of that on the template of the Exodus story. We'll look at that in future episodes. And then the apostles themselves think of all of cosmic history as one big playing out of the Exodus template, so to speak, of the enslavement of creation to death and decay and the liberation through the Messiah. So what we're going to look at today in this conversation is actually another repetition of the template. But there's a twist. So we talked about how, like the later prophets, Isaiah or the apostles will pick up the Exodus template and apply it to the future. What we're going to look at in Joshua and Judges is how Key elements of the story of Israel going into the land is itself portrayed as another repetition of the whole cycle of the road out, the road between, and the road into.", "start": "00:02:42", "end": "00:05:57", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "The New Pharaohs of Joshua and Judges"}, {"text": "So you're saying the road in is its own little micro exodus story?", "start": "00:05:57", "end": "00:06:01", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "The New Pharaohs of Joshua and Judges"}, {"text": "Yes, it's really, really remarkable.

After the death of Moses, the servant of Yahweh, Yahweh said to Yehoshua, Joshua, the son of nun, the assistant of Moses, saying, my servant Moses, he just died. So get up, cross the Jordan. Remember, the people have gone through the wilderness. That's the road in between. And they're poised about to go in on the east side of the Jordan River. They're camped out there, camped out there, and they have been for a little while. So cross the Jordan, you and all this people into the land. I'm giving them to the Israelites. Every place that the soles of your feet tread, I give it to you, just as I promised to Moses. And then you get a really expanded view of the territory of the promised land. From the wilderness in the Lebanon up to the great river Euphrates, the land of the Hittites, the great sea on the west.", "start": "00:06:01", "end": "00:07:52", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "The New Pharaohs of Joshua and Judges"}, {"text": "It's bigger than it ever will ever be.", "start": "00:07:52", "end": "00:07:54", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "The New Pharaohs of Joshua and Judges"}, {"text": "It's bigger than it will be by the end of Joshua's life.

Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. So you're given a clue right there that all of the ways that Yahweh was with Moses and what Moses did, now Joshua's own life as his protege will be, as it were, another recycling or a replaying. And it'll be different because it's Joshua, not Moses. But there will be a deep similarity. This is just a hint that I am to be looking for similarities with Moses story.

And all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of your presence. Her words are echoing the song of the sea that we meditated on in the last episode. And the point of that song was to say what Yahweh did to Egypt and Pharaoh, he is going to replay with the inhabitants of the land of Canaan.

So this is another moment where, like Moses was delivered by these seven women at the beginning of the Exodus story who use counter deception. Right. To deceive a bad king. So also, here's this questionable woman using counter deception to save life, and then she ends up getting woven into the line of Jesus. Of Jesus. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I mean, this is, I guess, maybe like a trope in stories or movies that set you up to think this is going to be like a good guy story and a bad guy story.

And I just want to show you a few examples. And again, this was illuminating for me to think about how the story is portraying the Canaanites and why the Israelites were in conflict with them. So chapter five, verse one. It happened when all the kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites by the sea heard that Yahweh dried up the waters of the Jordan.

When they all heard this, they gathered themselves together to fight. And this is where the real conflicts with the Canaanites begins, is in Joshua 9. There's been two battles so far, Jericho, which was kind of like a half battle because God did that one. And they do go and attack another city called AI, which fails at first.

Here they're groaning out because of their self created slavery, so to speak. But Yahweh would raise up deliverers and deliver them, but when that leader died, they would relapse and even act more corruptly. So not only are the Israelites the new Pharaoh, but then they also become the suffering Israelites, but they are their own oppressors now.

And if you only hear one, you're going to hear an imbalanced portrait of human nature and also of God's purposes. So a lot of this is about the complexity and the outworkings through generations of human decisions and later generations dealing with the consequences of the decisions of earlier generations. Yet they're also accountable for the decisions that they make in their own time and place. And it's such a mess that it does create the.
