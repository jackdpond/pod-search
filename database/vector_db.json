[{"text": "Foreign. Welcome to the BibleProject podcast. Today we start a new series that we're calling the Exodus Way. There is a way out of slavery, a way through the wilderness, and a way into the land of inheritance. In this theme conversation we'll discover that this is not just a journey that ancient Israel went on when they were rescued from slavery in Egypt. It's also the journey we're invited on. In fact, what we'll find is that this is the journey the entire country cosmos is on. The path from death into life. The highway through the wilderness, the Exodus way.

I think the creation stories, especially the seven day story and the Eden story are just like 101.

It's a bit more complex of a question than you might think, but in Its essence, it refers to the storyline where the main family that's at the center of the biblical story, which is the family of Israel, the descendants of Abraham, they end up enslaved in Egypt and oppressed, and they cry out to God. God raises up a deliverer, Moses, for them. And then there's a big showdown between Yahweh, the God of Israel, and Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, resulting in. In Passover, where a plague passes through the land, but those whose houses are covered by the blood of the lamb are delivered from the plague, and they are released to go out of the land into freedom. God rescues them, parting the waters through the sea, they go through the wilderness and on their way to the promised land.", "start": "00:05:31", "end": "00:06:23", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "Okay, that's the Prince of Egypt.

Yeah. They weren't making it up. So my goal in just this first step of the conversation is to convince you or anybody who's wondering, why isn't it just an interesting and important story? Why does it rank among the most category setting, foundation setting stories in the Bible? To understand that, let's actually turn to some foundational questions about Jesus and the New Testament that really are only resolved once you see how they connect to the meaning of the Exodus story. Okay, for example, why did Jesus choose Passover weekend as the week when he would show up in Jerusalem and poke the bear, that is provoked Jerusalem's leaders, the priestly and religious leaders, for his showdown with the powers there? Like, it's not random. Every one of the Gospels accounts has its whole climax to the story of Jesus presented with Jesus going to Jerusalem on a particular set of seven days leading up to a weekend.", "start": "00:06:33", "end": "00:07:40", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "Yeah.

It's the week of Passover.", "start": "00:07:41", "end": "00:07:48", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "That's right.

And Passover, what you just said was part of the Exodus story.", "start": "00:07:50", "end": "00:07:55", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "That's right.

Resolves.", "start": "00:07:55", "end": "00:08:00", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "How does God get them out of Egypt? The whole events, what we call Passover, God's final plague, the 10th plague, putting the blood on the doorway. And that's the Passover feast that every year you celebrate.", "start": "00:08:00", "end": "00:08:13", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "Yep, that's right. It's not random. And the Gospel authors didn't make this up. Jesus chose that time to go to Jerusalem and he knew he. He was going to get killed. He kept talking about it to his followers, and they really didn't understand what he was trying to tell them. So not only that, but then on the night before his arrest, he chose to time it in proximity to the actual Passover meal. Like the ritual meal that had been celebrated every year for over 1000 years connected to the night they were delivered from Egypt. And then Jesus explained the meaning of. Of his life leading up to that point and of what was about to happen in his death in terms of the actual, like, bread and the wine of the Passover meal. So Passover is of huge significance if we want to understand Jesus. And Passover is like a linchpin moment in the Exodus story. I guess what would be an analogy. It would be someone choosing a certain holiday whose meaning give a big announcement is so packed to everyone, and then they do on that day something that gives a twist and they don't have to use words.", "start": "00:08:13", "end": "00:09:28", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "Well, the one that's not a twist is getting married on Valentine's Day.

I guess this is, you know, making up something, you know, fictional. But if somebody in America, that's our context, wanted to start a new political or social movement and choosing July 4th, which marks, you know, a war of independence.", "start": "00:09:43", "end": "00:10:12", "series": "The Exodus Way", "episode": "Episode 1: An Exodus Shaped Reality"}, {"text": "Yeah, yeah.

Okay, so Jesus choosing Passover as the week of the showdown and Passover meal to explain the meaning of his death. And it's why Jesus words are so short and cryptic.

Yeah. So just that one right there. Like, what is more foundational than the story of Jesus death and the meaning of his Death in the Lord's Supper. And the Lord's Supper is a Passover meal. And to understand the meaning of the meal and a Passover, you need to understand what's going on in the Exodus story. So that's kind of, for me, that's low hanging fruit, like, oh, I should probably understand the meaning of the Exodus story if I want to gain a deeper understanding into the meaning of Jesus death and of the Lord's Supper, which is a ritual, you know, that most Christians do on a weekly or monthly or some kind of rhythmic basis.

So consistently to go from Israel, Palestine to Egypt was referred to as going down Yarad, to go down to Egypt and then to go from Egypt to the land of Israel is to go up. Okay, so that phrase to go out of Egypt or to go up from Egypt, that phrase appears 99 times. Those two phrases. One of those two phrases appears 99 times within the book of Exodus itself. And then as you move on, the phrase to go out of Egypt or to go up from Egypt, referencing back like these are mentions of the Exodus story going back 17 times in Leviticus, it's referenced in the next scroll of the Torah of numbers 32 times. The departure from Egypt is mentioned in deuteronomy, it's mentioned 56 times. So just within the Torah itself, after it happens, we're referring back to it all the time. Yeah, all the time. And as you go on, it's mentioned 18 times in Joshua, it's mentioned 2 times in Judges, 23 times in 1st and 2nd Kings, it's mentioned 35 times in the prophets, Isaiah, Malachi.

One biblical scholar I learned from his name, Brian Estelle, who wrote a wonderful book about this very topic. It's a book called Echoes of Exodus. Tracing a biblical motif. He puts it this way, he says the Exodus motif is the Bible's grand narrative. And it is one of the best stories because it encompasses all the major aspects of God's work of salvation through Christ, redemption from sin, suffering, and from the tyranny of the devil. It's an exodus from Egypt from Pharaoh, bringing us into the presence of God represented in Mount Sinai.

So really, from Exodus to Joshua, especially helpful here are, like in the Psalms, there'll be psalms that recite the foundation story of Israel as for why they should praise God or why Israel should trust God. So I'm thinking about Psalm 78, 105, 136. And those all go from slavery to entry into the promised land. And sometimes they'll tell it in just a few phrases, but it seems like for later biblical authors, that's the art. So it's both an Exodus, a road out of Egypt.
